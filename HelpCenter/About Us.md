# Why this? Why now?
For years, the real estate process remained relatively unchanged.

The home sale process is daunting and elusive. Knowledge and power are kept with the privileged few, and potential homeowners are often alienated. Real estate transactions just haven’t kept up with our increasingly digital age— and the online realty platforms that do exist stop after the initial search, forcing you to rely on disjointed communication and guesswork.

It’s about time that changed.

REsynque works differently. Our platform streamlines the entire property transaction, guiding you step-by-step through the process. We provide critical information each step of the way and give you accessible and manageable action steps that move you towards closing.

We’ve engineered, designed, and written the REsynque platform to:

- Bring the efficiency and ease of 21st century technology into the age-old practice of property transactions.
- Uphold the intimacy and joy of the human connections that real estate exchange creates
- Empower buyers and sellers to take control of their transactions and their futures. 

It’s time to refresh the process and reconnect the people who matter most. It’s time to REsynque.
