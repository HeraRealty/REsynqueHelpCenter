What is a Timeline?
-------------------

The "Timeline" is a visual tool used to show the milestones and steps involved in your real estate transaction. Each Timeline provides a chronological sequence of events specific to the buyer, seller, and agent, and is used to plan, schedule, and track the progress of the transaction.

If you are a seller, a new Timeline will step you through the options for listing your home (i.e. with or without an agent), the pre-marketing process, listing your home on REsynque, managing offers online, and the many other tasks required from contract through closing.

Once an offer is made, the timelines are merged and shared with all parties involved, including the seller, the buyer, and the agents (if any), to ensure everyone is aware of the progress and keep the transaction on track.

Who can use REsynque?

Using an agent
==============

Do I need a real estate agent to use REsynque?
----------------------------------------------

While using a professional real estate agent provides many advantages, you do not need to have an agent to get through a home purchase or sale. REsynque allows sellers and buyers to connect with each other whether they are working with an agent or not, and provides detailed information every step of the way. 

Should I hire a real estate agent to represent me?
--------------------------------------------------

Connecting with a real estate agent in REsynque can be a great asset for your success. 

Real estate agents are licensed professionals that can help guide you through the complicated process of buying or selling a home. Agents can provide valuable insights like local market conditions,  contract negotiation, qualified third-parties to assist the sale like lenders, attorneys, and inspectors, and many other resources to help answer any questions you have during the process. 

Who should use a real estate agent?
-----------------------------------

If you are unfamiliar with the home sale process, connecting with a real estate agent in REsynque can be a great asset for your success. For example, first-time home buyers, or down-sizers who last sold a home more than 20 years ago will have much quicker success with a real estate agent by their side.

On the other hand, if you have recent experience in real estate sales or are a real estate investor, you may have been through enough transactions so that REsynque's guidance will be enough to ensure a smooth transaction. 

Do I have to pay a real estate commission?
------------------------------------------

Typically, when you use a real estate agent to buy or sell a property, the agent will charge a commission for their time and expertise. The commission is typically a percentage of the sale price of the property, and split between the buyer's and seller's agents. The exact percentage can vary depending on the area, the agent, or the brokerage. It is also possible to find an agent who works for a flat fee instead of a commission.

Either way, it is important to understand the terms of the commission and any additional fees before you begin working with an agent. Be sure to ask your agent about their commission structure and any other fees you can expect to pay before hiring one to represent you. 

How can I find an agent?
------------------------

It's important to find a real estate agent who you feel comfortable with and can meet your specific needs. It's also important to have a face-to-face meeting before signing any agreement. There are several ways you can find a suitable agent, including asking for referrals from friends or family members who have recently bought or sold a home, searching online for agents in your area, or contacting a local real estate agency or brokerage.

Once you've chosen an agent you like and want to move forward with, simply add them to your transaction and you will be connected until closing. Simple as that!

Why should I interview potential agents?
----------------------------------------

Your agent will be representing you in the largest financial investment of your life, so no matter who you work with, make sure you choose the right agent based on their qualifications. This means that they know the local market well, understand the transaction process, have a good list of preferred local vendors, act in a professional manner,  and are responsive to all parties involved.

The very best way you can learn more about your agent's qualifications is by conducting a brief interview with any candidates you are considering.  You are going to spend a lot of time with your agent, and an interview will help you  know upfront if a working relationship is possible.

Here are some interview questions that may be worth asking

### Buyer agent interview questions

-   Can you walk me through the process of buying a home so I can set proper expectations? Setting proper expectations is one of the most important reasons you should hire an agent. The home sale process is long and complicated, and smooth transactions can take 45-60 days from offer acceptance to close. Making sure you have all relevant information before making an offer can be the difference between excitement and "buyer's remorse" once you are under contract on a home.

-   What do you consider the most important pieces to have in place before submitting and negotiating an offer?  Negotiating an offer relies heavily on knowing the market value of the home in relation to the list price.  Reading through the seller's disclosure and performing a comparative market analysis (CMA) to analyze similar home sales in the area will help you negotiate any offer from a more powerful position.

-   What do you think my greatest  challenges will be in finding a home? And how do you think we should approach those challenges? No home is perfect, and deciding to compromise the biggest purchase of your life is hard. . The answer to this question will reveal the agent's grasp on the local market and the expectations of today's buyers and sellers in your area.

-   What kind of team and resources do you have around you to support this process? The best agents have a great team around them to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. This does not mean a single agent is not capable;  it means that all agents use a network of professionals -- photographers, attorneys, inspectors, etc.-- and technology tools like REsynque to help them provide the best service to their clients.

-   Do you have a network of professionals-- like attorneys, inspectors, and contractors-- that you work with often and could recommend throughout the process? This is a follow up question to find out more about the "team around the agent." There are many many people involved in a real estate transaction, and having a competent and experienced team around you is vital to the success of the sale.

### Seller agent interview questions

-   Can you walk me through the process of selling a home so I can set proper expectations? Setting proper expectations is one of the most important reasons you should hire an agent. The home sale process is long and complicated, and smooth transactions take at least 45-60 days from list to close. Showing your home and keeping your home clean is disruptive, and it is imperative that you can trust your agent to set the tone for the process early to avoid constant frustration.

-   What type of marketing will you perform to get my home in front of as many buyers as possible?  Marketing a home is literally how you find your buyer: The more people that see your home for sale, the more likely you are to find a buyer quickly. In today's markt, professional photographers are a must, as well as online exposure on popular websites and social media. A good agent is familiar with the most recent and up-to-date marketing platforms that will be useful to get the exposure you need.

-   What do you think the list price of my home should be?  A good agent will have a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) done before meeting with you, and should have at least a suggested range for you to consider.

-   What are the biggest challenges you think will be in selling my home? And how do you think we should approach those challenges? No home is perfect, and if you are going to ask someone to make the single highest purchase of their lives on your home, there will be challenges. The answer to this question will expose the agent's grasp on the local market and the expectations of today's buyer in your market.

-   What kind of team and resources do you have around you to support this process? As previously stated, there is a lot of work that goes into selling a home, and the best agents have a great team around them to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. This does not mean a single agent is not capable; it means that all agents use a network of professionals around them - photographers, attorneys, inspectors, etc - and technology tools like REsynque to help them provide the best service to their clients.

-   Do you have a network of professionals- like attorneys, inspectors, and contractors- that you work with often that you could recommend throughout the process? This is a follow up question to the team around the agent. There are many many people involved throughout a real estate transaction, and having a competent and experienced team around you is vital to the success of the sale.

What if I'm already using an agent to sell or buy a home?
---------------------------------------------------------

REsynque understands that using a professional real estate agent is a great advantage for any homesale. That's why we've built a dashboard specifically to help agents manage their workflow and connect with clients. In REsynque, your agent can complete tasks alongside you, recommend vendors and contacts, manage required paperwork, and update all of your Milestones.

What if my real estate agent is not in the  REsynque network?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Invite them to join! REsynque is a free resource that helps agents communicate and get organized, too.  When you start a transaction, you can invite any agent to join. Once they sign up, they'll be connected to your transaction and can manage its progress in real time.

If an agent doesn't want to use REsynque, no worries! You can still use the platform to help you complete tasks and guide you through the process of buying or selling your home.

Can I fire my real estate agent if I'm unhappy with their services?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can fire your real estate agent. If you are not satisfied with the service provided by your agent or you decide to go in a different direction, you have the right to terminate your relationship with them.

It's important to note that, if you have signed a buyer's representation agreement or a listing agreement, you should read it carefully to understand the terms and notice period in case you want to terminate the agreement.

It's also important to communicate your decision clearly and professionally with your agent, and provide them with any relevant feedback on why you have decided to terminate the relationship.

It's a good idea to have a face to face meeting to discuss your concerns and see if there is any way to resolve them before terminating the agreement.

Once you and your agent have agreed to part ways, you can remove your agent from your transaction and terminate all connections to you and your transaction. 

Buying a home
=============

Why should I use REsynque to search for my home?
------------------------------------------------

REsynque provides a convenient, centralized location for managing all aspects of the home buying process. Now you have one place to securely store and access important documents, such as contracts and disclosures, at any time from any device. It also streamlines communication between buyers, real estate agents, and other parties involved in the transaction, making it easier to coordinate tasks and stay on top of deadlines.

Using REsynque will save time, reduce stress, and provide a more efficient and transparent home buying experience.

What is a Timeline?
-------------------

The "Timeline" is a visual representation of the milestones and steps involved in your real estate transaction. Each Timeline provides a chronological sequence of events specific to the buyer, seller, and agent, and is used to plan, schedule, and track the progress of the transaction.

If you are a buyer just starting your search, you can use your search to generate a new Timeline that starts with the pre-approval process and choosing an agent (if any), and takes you through the steps needed before making an offer on a home.

If you are a buyer that's ready to make an offer, you can submit your offer directly to the seller on REsynque, and a Timeline will automatically generate to keep track of the journey. This timeline will keep you notified on  the offer negotiation process, and continue through attorney review, inspection, and the many other tasks required through closing.

Once any offer is made, your timeline connects with the seller, the buyer, and the agents (if any), to ensure everyone is aware of the progress and keep the transaction on track.

Can I search for more than one home to purchase at a time?
----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, REsynque can help you keep track of multiple home searches by creating a separate Timeline for each home search profile. This allows for a more flexible and efficient home search experience. 

Why can't I find the home I'm looking for on REsynque?
------------------------------------------------------

The home must be listed by the seller or their agent directly on REsynque in order to receive offers, whether they are already listed in the MLS or For Sale By Owner.  Any homes that are listed with a real estate agent will show up in the  "REsynque Listings" tab.

 If you are searching for a home and it is For Sale By Owner, make sure you are checking the "FSBO" tab for search results.

Selling a home
==============

Why should I use REsynque to list my home?
------------------------------------------

REsynque gives  you - the seller- the power to decide the terms of selling your home. Whether you want to use a full-service real estate agent, or sell it yourself as a For Sale By Owner (FSBO), now you can choose from all the options available based on what's best for you.

Once you've decided the best path for you to sell your home, REsynque will help you keep track of important dates and deadlines related to the sale of your home, such as home inspections, mortgage contingencies, and closing. It can also be used to organize and keep track of communications with potential buyers, their offers, and any negotiations that may have taken place. REsyqnue will help you stay on top of tasks that need to be completed before the sale, and make sure everyone stays on track throughout the process.

What is a Timeline?
-------------------

The "Timeline" is the visual representation  of the milestones and steps involved in your real estate transaction. Each Timeline provides a chronological sequence of events specific to the buyer, seller, and agent, and is used to plan, schedule, and track the progress of the transaction.

If you are a seller, a new Timeline will step you through the options for listing your home (i.e. with or without an agent), the pre-marketing process, listing your home on REsynque, managing offers online, and the many other tasks required from contract through closing.

Once any offer is made, the timelines are connected with all parties involved, including the seller, the buyer, and the agents (if any), to ensure everyone is aware of the progress and keep the transaction on track.

Do I need to use an agent to list my home on REsynque?
------------------------------------------------------

Using an agent can greatly increase your chances of closing your sale, but you can list your home on REsynque with or without a real estate agent.

REsynque can enhance the advantages of using a real estate agent by providing a your agent with a centralized location to manage all aspects of the home buying or selling process, streamlining communication and document sharing, and providing real-time updates to ensure everyone is always informed and up-to-date.

If you choose to list your home as a "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO), REsynque provides you with  basic guidance to take on all the selling responsibilities, including listing, marketing, and negotiating the transaction with any buying party.  

Do I need to pay a commission to list my home?
----------------------------------------------

That is up to you. If you want to have a licensed real estate agent help you list your home, then it is only fair to compensate that agent for their time and expertise. If you choose not to use a listing agent (i.e. For Sale By Owner or "FSBO"), you should still consider offering a commission to buyer agents as an incentive to bring their clients to your home.

Either way, whether or not you want to offer a commission should be one of the first decisions you make before listing your home to avoid any confusion or conflict. 

Can I sell or buy more than one home at a time?
-----------------------------------------------

Yes! REsynque allows you to manage multiple transactions at the same time. This means that REsynque can support people selling and buying a home at the same time, or real estate investors who frequently buy and sell multiple properties.

What is a "FSBO?"
-----------------

"FSBO" stands for "For Sale By Owner" and used to label a home sale that doesn't have representation from a real estate broker or agent. In an FSBO listing, the seller is in charge of listing, marketing, and selling a home. FSBO listings can accept offers online, and REsynque still connects all parties to the transaction so everyone always knows the current status of the timeline.

Do I have to offer a commission to list For Sale By Owner (FSBO) on REsynque?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you do not have to offer a commission to list as a For Sale By Owner on REsynque, but offering a buyer's agent commission would be a valuable incentive for agents to bring their clients to view the property. Keep in mind that 88% of homebuyers in 2021 bought their home through a real estate broker or agent (source: [NAR 2021 Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-11-11-2021.pdf)). Therefore, unless you already know the buyer, offering a commission to buyer's agents will greatly increase your chances for a successful sale.

Either way, it is best to determine the commission rate and structure before offering it for sale to avoid any confusion or conflict.

What if I want to list my home on the MLS?
------------------------------------------

You can still list your home on any local MLS through a licensed real estate agent to increase exposure to your home. You will also have to add it to REsynque to receive offers and manage the transaction.

Does listing on REsynque automatically list my home in an MLS?

Listing your home in the MLS does not currently transfer the listing to REsynque, although this feature will be available in 2023. At this time, you will need to manually add and activate your listing to REsynque to receive offers and manage the transaction.

The offer process - general
===========================

Are offers submitted on REsynque binding?
-----------------------------------------

The offer terms submitted on our site are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a substitute for a formal purchase agreement. A binding agreement for the purchase of the home typically requires a written and signed contract, and the terms of that contract must be agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller. If an offer is accepted by the seller through REsynque, this alone would not typically meet these requirements and would not be considered a binding agreement.

It is your responsibility to seek the advice of a professional attorney to draft a formal purchase agreement that meets your specific needs and complies with all applicable laws and regulations. It is always recommended to consult with a legal professional to ensure proper understanding of the process. 

What if the offer does not have any contract paperwork attached?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Any offer submitted through REsynque will require general offer terms such as offer price, type of financing, closing date, and any contingencies, but paperwork is not required to submit an offer to the seller.

In this case, the seller may ask for a signed contract in their counter offer, since any offer terms submitted on our site should not be considered a substitute for a formal purchase agreement.

If the seller accepts an offer that does not provide a written contract, then REsynque's Timeline will require a written and signed contract to move forward in the process.

It is your responsibility to seek the advice of a professional attorney to draft a formal purchase agreement that meets your specific needs and complies with all applicable laws and regulations. It is always recommended to consult with a legal professional to ensure proper understanding of the process. 

The offer process - sellers
===========================

Why should I use REsynque to accept offers on my home?
------------------------------------------------------

REsynque gives you an all-in-one tool for quicker response times and efficient communication with interested buyers. It also allows you to consider multiple offers in a more organized manner and potentially reach a larger pool of buyers. Additionally, online offers can provide a digital record of the transaction, making it easier to track and manage the sale process.

How do I receive offers directly on REsynque?
---------------------------------------------

From the seller's timeline, you can "Activate" your listing on REsynque to receive offers directly from buyers and/or buyer's agents. 

How will I know when I receive an offer on REsynque?
----------------------------------------------------

Once any offer is submitted on REsynque, you will receive an email notification in real-time with a brief summary of the offer terms.  Once you log into your timeline, you will be able to view the full offer terms and any documents that were submitted with the offer. 

What happens if I receive multiple offers?
------------------------------------------

When you receive multiple offers, it can be overwhelming to keep track of them all. However, there are tools available that allow you to see all offers in one place. With this, you can easily compare the offers side by side and make an informed decision. Once you have made your decision, you can respond to each offer individually, or you can accept one offer, which will automatically reject all other offers received. This feature saves you time and ensures that you don't miss out on any opportunities.

How do I respond to an offer?
-----------------------------

Once you receive an offer, you can accept, counter, or reject the offer directly on the "Manage Offers" milestone of your Timeline.

The offer process - buyers
==========================

Why should I use REsynque to make an offer on a property?
---------------------------------------------------------

Submitting an offer online for a home purchase can save time and streamline the buying process by eliminating the need for in-person meetings or paper documents. It also allows for easier communication between the buyer and seller and can provide a quicker response time, which is especially important in competitive markets. Additionally, it allows buyers to submit offers from anywhere, making the process more convenient and accessible.

How do I make an offer on a property?
-------------------------------------

To find a home that you want to submit an offer, you can either search the REsynque listings page or the seller can provide a direct link to the property. Each listing has a "Make an Offer" prompt that will allow you to submit your offer terms, attach documents like a pre-approval and purchase contract, and any other paperwork required . Once submitted, the offer term sheet and attachments are sent directly to the seller and any agent involved. You can view the offer terms you submitted while you wait for a response from the seller.

What if I want to withdraw an offer I made on a property?
---------------------------------------------------------

No problem! As long as the offer has not been accepted, you can withdraw an offer you made at any time directly on REsynque.

If your offer has been accepted and a fully signed contract has been exchanged, then you will need to defer to your attorney on how to properly cancel the transaction in writing. Once the proper written termination is obtained, you can cancel the transaction on REsynque and begin a new search.

If I'm working with an agent, who submits the offer?
----------------------------------------------------

Either you or your agent can submit the offer on any listing. However if your agent is helping you with the paperwork, then it would be easier for your agent to submit the offer on the listing to ensure  everything is completed properly. Once the offer is submitted, you will both receive confirmation notifications as they are set in your settings. 

How will I know if the seller responds to my offer?
---------------------------------------------------

You will receive an instant notification as soon as the seller responds to your offer. It typically means that they have reviewed your offer and are providing a counteroffer, acceptance, or rejection. 

If the seller accepts your offer, then a legally binding contract is created, and the transaction moves forward to the next steps, such as arranging financing, conducting inspections, and finalizing the sale.

If the seller provides a counteroffer, it means that they are proposing changes to the terms of your initial offer, such as the purchase price, closing date, or contingencies. You can then review the counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or provide a counter-counteroffer. This negotiation process can go back and forth until both parties reach an agreement, or until one party decides to walk away from the deal.

If the seller rejects your offer, it means they are choosing not to move forward with your terms as presented, and you can either submit a new offer, or begin a new home search.

It's important to note that the response time for a seller to your online home purchase offer may vary depending on their situation and personal preferences. It could take a few hours, days, or even weeks for the seller to respond. It's always a good idea to work with a real estate agent or attorney to ensure that the negotiation process goes smoothly and that your interests are protected.

I am not working with an agent, can I still make an offer on REsynque?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! If the home is listed on REsynque, you can either submit your offer terms directly to the seller, or if you can contact the listing agent to help you submit your offer.

Why can't I make more than one offer at a time?
-----------------------------------------------

REsynque only allows one active offer at a time to ensure the seller receives legitimate offers from interested buyers, and minimize the risk of fraudulent bids or scams. This helps maintain the integrity of the real estate market and protects both the buyers and sellers involved. Therefore, you can only have one active offer submitted at a time unless and until a pending offer is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. 

For agents
==========

How do I get started?
---------------------

Agents can create their own account with their brokerage information, and manage multiple clients and transactions from your dashboard. 

What is a timeline?
-------------------

The "Timeline" is the visual representation  of the milestones and steps involved in your real estate transaction. Each Timeline provides a chronological sequence of events specific to the buyer, seller, and agent, and is used to plan, schedule, and track the progress of the transaction.

As an agent, a timeline is created for every client and will step you through the many other tasks required from contract through closing. Once any offer is made, the buyer and seller timelines are connected with all parties involved, and you will be able to keep track of the transaction as it progresses.

What if I'm representing the buyer and the seller for a transaction?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are representing the buyer and the seller in the same transaction, then each client would have their own timeline, which is represented by their own card on your dashboard. This helps you separate the buyer and seller specific tasks needed to get to closing, and ensures that your role as their agent stays focused on one client at a time.

What happens when the transaction is closed?
--------------------------------------------

Once a transaction closes, the timeline will close and get stored in your archived transactions. You will be able to view the summary or the transaction from your archive, and your metrics will be automatically updated.

What if my clients don't want to use REsynque?
----------------------------------------------

Bummer. But you can still use REsynque to keep them on track and organized. Your clients will also still receive automatic updates on important milestones like offer updates, and you can use the REsynque timeline as a guide on the steps needed throughout the transaction.

Why did a client appear on my dashboard?
----------------------------------------

Congrats! This means your client added you as their agent in their timeline, and the connection is complete! Now you can both see real-time updates together as they happen in the homesale journey.
