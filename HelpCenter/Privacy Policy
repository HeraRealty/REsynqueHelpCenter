Welcome to REsynque.com ("Site"), which is owned and operated by Resynque, Inc.   ("Resynque).  This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about Resynque's collection, use, and dissemination practices regarding information that you provide to Resynque through this Site.

Your use of this Site is subject to this Privacy Policy, which you may at any time print or download. Whenever you submit information to Resynque through the Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Resynque reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised policy at this location, but such changes will not affect information provided by you prior to the effective date of the change unless you consent otherwise. Your use of the Site shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any changes, modifications or alterations thereof.  Your consent to these and any new terms will be required in order for you to continue to use the Site.  You are responsible for periodically reviewing this page.

We encourage you to check back and review this policy periodically so that you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.

**How we collect information about you:**

When you request information from Resynque via this Site, you will be asked to provide basic contact information (e.g., name, organization, address, phone number, e-mail address, fax number, and so on). On this Site, for example, we may collect and retain contact and other information from you in a number of ways, such as when you request e-mail updates or other information, complete customer surveys, or submit a feedback or contact form.

This Site also collects various non-personally identifiable information from you in the course of your navigation of the Site, such as the URL of the site you just came from, the browser version you use, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, IP ports, date/time, size of data transferred, pages you visit, and other "clickstream" data.

**How we use information about you:**

Resynque uses information collected by clickstream data collection to improve web site navigation, compile and analyze aggregate statistics and trends, and otherwise help administer and improve the Site.

Except as otherwise stated, Resynque may use information it collects from you and others to respond to your request, improve the content, services, and products that Resynque provides, communicate information to you, for our marketing and research analysis, and for other purposes identified to you. Resynque reserves the right to make full use of information that is not in personally identifiable form.

From time to time, Resynque uses contact information obtained via this Site to send e-mails and postal mail to you with the most recent product and service information (unless you have expressed a preference otherwise).

The information you provide to us, including your information obtained from cookies, may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Resynque maintains its servers.  By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States and/or to any other country.

**How information may be disclosed and how it is protected:**

Resynque does not provide the personally identifiable information you supply to us to third parties.

Resynque takes reasonable steps online and offline to safeguard the information you provide to us. We may disclose personally identifiable information that you provide via this site to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, regulations, or court orders. Furthermore, we may disclose information provided by you in connection with corporate restructuring, sale or assignment of assets, merger, divestiture, and other changes of control or financial status, in which case we will require the recipient to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Because no system is completely secure or error-free despite taking commercially reasonable steps, Resynque does not promise, and you should not expect, that information you provide to Resynque shall remain private under all circumstances. It is your responsibility to safeguard any passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features associated with your use of the Site.

**Opting out:**

If you do not wish to receive certain communications from Resynque, you may opt out by: (1) declining the service offered when registering or at other information collection points on the Site, or (2) informing us that you no longer wish to receive such communications. We will comply with such requests unless such communications are necessary for the administration of your account, required by law, or necessary to protect our rights.

**Access to information you provide:**

You may at any time request access to a summary of the information you provided at web registration, and request corrections or updates to that information. Resynque will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to such requests, but reserves the right to limit such requests to two per year per individual. Further, our response to such requests may be limited to information under our direct control.

**Other web sites:**

This Site may contain links to the web sites of other organizations. Resynque is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites, and unless otherwise specified, does not imply any relationship, sponsorship, or affiliation between Resynque and these linked sites, or adoption or approval of the content of such sites. You should read the privacy policies of all websites that are linked to the Site.

**Severability:**

If any provision of this Privacy Policy is found to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severed from the balance of the agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, which will continue in full force and effect.

**California Privacy Rights:**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows users who are California residents to request information about the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please contact us at info@resynque.com.
